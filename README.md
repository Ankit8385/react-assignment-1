## Features

### Level 1: The Warm-up Challenge
#### Objective:
Build a basic Mood Tracker covering core React concepts and Tailwind CSS styling.

#### Functionality:
- **Mood Entry Creation:**
  - Users select a mood emoji from a dropdown list (e.g., ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜’, ðŸ˜¢).
  - Display the selected mood below the dropdown, including:
    - Date (current date and time, including seconds)
    - The selected emoji
    - Mood description (e.g., "Happy")

  **Example:**
  ```
  3/2/2025 6:30:59 ðŸ˜Š Happy
  ```

- **Mood List:**
  - Render all mood entries in a list format.

- **Global Clear Button:**
  - A "Clear" button appears when at least one mood entry is present.
  - Clicking the button clears all moods from the list.

- **UI and Styling:**
  - Use Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive UI design.

### Level 2: For Adventurers
#### Objective:
Enhance the application by introducing CRUD operations and richer UI components.

#### Additional Features:
- **Individual Mood Deletion:**
  - Users can delete specific mood entries from the list.
  - The UI updates accordingly.

- **Undo Logic:**
  - Implement an "Undo" feature to revert the last deletion or action.
  - Maintain a history of changes to restore deleted entries.

- **Tabbed Interface:**
  - **Tabs Component:** A switcher for different views.
  - **Mood List Tab:** Displays all mood entries with options to delete or undo actions.
  - **Mood Analytics Tab:** Placeholder for analytics (expanded in Level 3).
  - **UI Enhancements:** Clearly styled tabs with active state indicators and smooth transitions.

### Level 3: Already a PRO!
#### Objective:
Introduce advanced UI components and data visualization for analytics.

#### Advanced Features:
- **Local Persistence:**
  - Store mood entries in `localStorage` to persist across page refreshes.

- **Mood Analytics Dashboard:**
  - **Charts and Graphs:**
    - Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) to visualize mood trends.
    - Display mood frequency using bar or pie charts.

- **Extra UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - **Modal Dialogs:**
    - Confirm critical actions (e.g., clearing all moods) using modals.
  - **Animated Notifications:**
    - Provide visual feedback using `react-toastify` or custom animations for actions like adding, updating, or deleting moods.
